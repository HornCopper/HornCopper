I am very honor for your coming. At the time when I joined the GitHub, I am just a primary student. Till now I have become a senior high school student. If you have something to contact me. Just email to `x3349104868@gmail.com`ã€‚

I hate someone who are fired from my repository but continue to use the codes there and publish them to the public platform, although he has stronger ability than me.

I am a member of `codethink`, [click there](https://github.com/codethink-cn/).
